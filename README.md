 3. Return to step 1, unless the word 'quit' was entered.

Exercise #3: 
 1. Prompts the user to enter a dog's age in human years like this:
      Input a dog's age in human years:
 2. Calculates the equivalent dog years, where:
      - The first two years count as 10 years each
      - Any remaining years count as 7 years each
 3. Prints the answer in the following format:
      The dog's age in dog years is xx

Exercise #4: 
 1. Prompts the user to enter the three lengths of a triangle (one at a time):
      Enter the lengths of three side of a triangle: 
 2. Write the code that determines if the triangle is:
      equalateral - all three sides are equal in length
      scalene - all three sides are unequal in length
      isosceles - two sides are the same length
 3. Print a message such as:
      - A triangle with sides of a, b & c is a "type of triangle" triangle

Exercise #5: 
 1. Calculates and prints the first 50 terms of the fibonacci sequence.
 2. Print each term and number as follows:


Exercise #6: 
1. Prompts the user to enter the month (as three characters):
      Enter the month of the season (Jan - Dec):
 2. Then promptshtt the user to enter the day of the month:
      Enter the day of the month:
 3. Calculate what season it is based upon this chart:
      Dec 21 - Mar 19: Winter
      Mar 20 - Jun 20: Spring
      Jun 21 - Sep 21: Summer
      Sep 22 - Dec 20: Fall
 4. Print the result as follows: "Mmm"/"dd" is in "season"
